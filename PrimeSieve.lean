/- A prime sieve implementation can model `R p` by providing
a bijection between `R p` and its internal data structures.

For RakeSieve, this is exposed to the type system by attaching
a predicate to the internal data structure.

Whatever the sieve does to "sift out" multiples of the next
prime `p₁` is equivalent to the expression  `∧ ¬(p₁∣n)`.

The following theorem allows us to construct a predicate for
membership in `R pₙ` by induction using predicates of this
form at each step. -/

PrimeSieveDriver provides the generic proof that a
A PrimeSieve is a PrimeGen that uses a SieveState to generate primes.
In practice, this means that it somehow models the set of natural
numbers greater than 1 that are coprime to a list of known primes,
and then repeatedly:
  - obtains the minimum of this set as the next prime
  - eliminates multiples of the new prime. -/
